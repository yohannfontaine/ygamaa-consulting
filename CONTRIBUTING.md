For any topic (bug, new feature, etc.), please create an issue to discuss it before making any changes. Each topic should be handled in a separate branch. A simple flow like [Github flow](https://docs.github.com/fr/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) can be used:
- feat/num_issue_shortdescription
- fix/num_issue_shortdescription

## Pull Request Process

2. Update the documentation, particularly the README.md if necessary (new properties, etc.).
